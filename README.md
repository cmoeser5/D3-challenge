# Data Journalism and D3

## Background
Analyzed the health risks facing particular demographics with the dataset provided by creating charts, graphs and interactive elements. The dataset used is from the U.S. Census Bureau is based on the 2014 ACS (American Community Survey) and included data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, smoking, age and lack of healthcare.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* D3
* HTML

### Static Image of Scatter Plot
Created dynamic scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. The plot includes additional labels and has click elements so users can decide which data to display. The plot also includes animation transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of axes.
